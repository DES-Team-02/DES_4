# Common API

## Table of Contents

## Introduction
CommonAPI is a middleware developed by the GENIVI Alliance. It is a framework that allows the development of in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) applications. It is based on the concept of service-oriented architecture (SOA) and provides a service-oriented middleware (SOM) that allows the development of applications independently of the underlying communication technology. 
If you have no knowledge about CommonAPI, vSOME/IP and Franca, we recommend to read the following [CommonAPI user guide] first.

## Fundamentals

### Communication Patterns
- Request-Response
- Fire-Forget 
- Subscribe-Notify
- Request-Response with Callback

## Project Notation 
For this project the vSOME/IP bining is used. 
To establish a reliable communication between the applications, the follwing notation between the applications is used. <br>
The used notation on the vSOME/IP interface is set in the dfidl files of each application. <br>

### Convention 

Usually, on-board networks like AUTOSAR and vSOME/IP use a clearly defined notation. (!! insert AUTOSAR DOC LINK here !!)

In this project, the following (lighet weighted) notation is used: <br>

- IDs are binded to the sequence number of the application. 
    - 1 = Head_Unit 
    - 2 = Dashboard 
    - 3 = Can_Speedsensor 
    - 4 = Car_Control 
    - 5 = Car_Info
- 0x | Appication sequence number | Eventgroup ID | Event ID | 
- Reliable mode = on
- Network: 
    - IP: 192.168.0.2 
    - Port: Starts with applications sequence number and ends with 0 or 1. 
        - 0 = Reliable
        - 1 = Unreliable

#### 1) Head_Unit
```yaml
    test
```

#### 2) Dashboard
```yaml
    test
```

#### 3) Can Speedsensor
```yaml
interface Can_Receiver.Speed_Sensor:
    SomeIpServiceID = 0x3000
    attribute speed {
        SomeIpGetterID              = 0x3101
        SomeIpSetterID              = 0x3102
        SomeIpNotifierID            = 33104
        SomeIpAttributeReliable     = false
        SomeIpNotifierEventGroups   = 33104
    attribute rpm {
        SomeIpGetterID              = 0x3201
        SomeIpSetterID              = 0x3202
        SomeIpNotifierID            = 33204
        SomeIpAttributeReliable     = false
        SomeIpNotifierEventGroups   = 33204
Service:
        InstanceId = "Speed_Sensor"
        SomeIpInstanceID = 22000
```
#### 4) Car Control:

```yaml
SomeIpServiceID = 4000
    attribute indicator:
        SomeIpNotifierEventGroups   = 4100
        SomeIpNotifierID            = 41000
        SomeIpGetterID              = 4101
        SomeIpAttributeReliable     = true
    attribute gear 
        SomeIpNotifierEventGroups   = 4200 
        SomeIpNotifierID            = 42000
        SomeIpGetterID              = 4201
    method gearSelectionHeadUnit 
        SomeIpMethodID              = 4200
Service: 
        InstanceId                  = "commonapi.CarControl"
        SomeIpInstanceID            = 4001
        SomeIpUnicastAddress        = "192.168.0.2"
        SomeIpReliableUnicastPort   = 40010
        SomeIpUnreliableUnicastPort = 40011
```

#### 5) Car_info: 

```yaml
interface commonapi.CarInfo:
    SomeIpServiceID = 5000
    attribute battery
        SomeIpNotifierEventGroups   = 5100
        SomeIpNotifierID            = 51000
        SomeIpGetterID              = 5101
        SomeIpAttributeReliable     = true

Service:
    InstanceId                      = "commonapi.CarInfo"
    SomeIpInstanceID                = 5001
    SomeIpUnicastAddress            = "192.168.0.2"
    SomeIpReliableUnicastPort       = 50010
    SomeIpUnreliableUnicastPort     = 50011
```

## Target Device Setup

CommonAPI vSomeIP Setup

### Install Dependencies
Java 8, Boost-dev, libdbus and ascii are required. 
See Some/IP documentations for more informations. 
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
sudo apt-get install libdbus-1-dev
sudo apt install ascii
```
Additionally, the piracer's drivetrain and battery control unit needs some python dependencies.
Install piracer-py package globally (not recommended). 
```bash
pip install piracer-py
```

### Build & Install the CommonAPI Core Runtime Library
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/GENIVI/capicxx-core-runtime.git
cd capicxx-core-runtime/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make 
sudo make install
```

### Build & Install the vSomeIP Library
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/COVESA/vsomeip.git
cd vsomeip
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DENABLE_SIGNAL_HANDLING=1 -DDIAGNOSIS_ADDRESS=0x10 ..
make
sudo make install
```

### Build the CommonAPI SOME/IP Runtime Library
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GENIVI/capicxx-someip-runtime.git
cd capicxx-someip-runtime
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DUSE_INSTALLED_COMMONAPI=OFF ..
make
sudo make install
```

### Write the Franca file 

### Generate Code with the CommonAPI Generator
Unfortunately, code generator [doesnâ€™t support arm architecture.]((https://github.com/COVESA/capicxx-core-tools/issues/19)). 
So if you want to use the generator, we recommend to use your own non-aarm machine. A more comfortable approach would be github actions. For this we developed a tool called [capicxx-tools-CI-CD] that is available in the SEA:ME's GitHub.
The code generator automatically generates codes according to fidl and fdepl files. 



```bash
/home/seame02/generator/core-generator/commonapi-core-generator-linux-x86_64 -sk ./fidl/carinfo.fidl -d ./src-gen-carinfo/core
/home/seame02/generator/someip-generator/commonapi-someip-generator-linux-x86_64  ./fidl/carinfo.fdepl -d ./src-gen-carinfo/someip
```
### Binding to vSOME/IP 
// https://github.com/SEA-ME/Team-Pilot/tree/Moon/Project-2/CommonAPI-vSomeIP
CommonAPI and available bindings can be configured by ini-files (see e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file).
The CommonAPI configuration file is commonapi.ini. There are three places where CommonAPI Runtime tries to find this
file (in the following order):
1. in the directory of the current executable. If there is a commonapi.ini file, it has the highest priority.
2. in the directory which is specified by the environment variable COMMONAPI_CONFIG.
3. in the global default directory /etc.
The configuration file has 4 possible sections; all sections are optional.
The default default binding is "dbus". This can be changed by setting the "binding" variable in the "default"-section of the CommonAPI configuration file or by setting the environment variable "COMMONAPI_DEFAULT_BINDING". The environment variable overwrites the setting provided by the configuration file.

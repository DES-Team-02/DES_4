## :microphone:  Introduction
This project is part of [SEA-ME Project](https://github.com/SEA-ME).
> This project aims to develop a **Head Unit application** running on a Raspberry Pi (RPi) alongside the previously developed PiRacer **Instrument Cluster application**. <br> 
The Head Unit application will provide additional features like ambient lighting, gear selection, and a media app. <br> 
Furthermore, the project will use **Scalable Service-Oriented Middlewareuse (SOME/IP)** to connect the applications and **Yocto as the build system** for the RPi. <br> 

You can see the full subject in this link. [SEA-ME/DES-Head-Unit](https://github.com/SEA-ME/DES_Head-Unit)

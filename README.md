## Introduction
This project is part of the embedded software development course at [SEA-ME](https://github.com/SEA-ME).
> This project aims to develop a **Head Unit application** running on a Raspberry Pi (RPi as ECU) alongside the previously developed PiRacer **Instrument Cluster application**. <br> 
The Head Unit application will provide additional features like **ambient lighting, gear selection, and a media app**. <br> 
Furthermore, the project will use **Scalable Service-Oriented Middlewareuse (vSOME/IP)** to connect the applications and **Yocto as the build system** for the ECU. <br>
